open with godot 3.5.3

3D Movement Prototype (Godot)
A basic 3D character controller built in Godot using GDScript.
Implements:

First-person camera look with mouse movement

WASD directional movement based on camera angle

Gravity, jump logic (with double jump), and sprint toggle

Ground/air acceleration handling

Primarily built to understand Godot's 3D physics (KinematicBody, move_and_slide) and camera transforms.
Not a full game â€” just a physics testbed.
